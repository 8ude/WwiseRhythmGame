# WwiseRhythmGame
Sample Rhythm Game for Babycastles Academy

This is the project repo for the BabyCastles academy class on creating Rhythm Games in Unity/Wwise!

Tech used:
Wwise version 2021.1.1.something
Unity version 2020.3.2

Familiarity + Pace
I'm hoping this is will be a pretty approachable workshop, but the example project might feel a bit high-level to new+beginner Unity users.  I'll try to slow down if I'm going too fast.  If we don't get to everything, you'll at least have the project repo to draw from.
