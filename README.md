# WwiseRhythmGame
Sample Rhythm Game for Babycastles Academy

This is the project repo for the BabyCastles academy class on creating Rhythm Games in Unity/Wwise!

[Slides are available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fQVSYs5EKnu26jL4AQlMtb9-fXGOVe64DrgLHwGRwdE/edit?usp=sharing)

Tech used:
Wwise version 2021.1.1.something
Unity version 2020.3.2

Familiarity + Pace
I'm hoping this is will be a pretty approachable workshop, but the example project might feel a bit high-level to new+beginner Unity users.  I'll try to slow down if I'm going too fast.  If we don't get to everything, you'll at least have the project repo to draw from.

We're using two rather big and clunky pieces of software (both Unity and Wwise take years to fully master).  I'm hoping we can at least get them "good enough" to do what we need them for - creating rhythm games!

Try to have Unity and Wwise installed before the class starts.  Unity is a big installer and can take a while.

# Outline:
## Part 1: set up and rhythm game design
- Downloading the project repo
- What's a rhythm game, and how do you make one?
- Call-Response gameplay
- Evaluation windows
- Some common issues in making music-based games.

## Part 2: the Unity project
- Testing the game in Unity
- Where to change what buttons are used.
- On beat + on bar effects

## Part 3: the Wwise project
- quick overview of Wwise
  - music, events, and sound banks
  - creating sounds (because you can't use Unity audio)
  - all the fancy stuff we won't touch for this class
- the musical view + timeline
  - import music, set the tempo correctly
